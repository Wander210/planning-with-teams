## 📖 What is planning-with-teams?

planning-with-teams helps you run and manage multiple AI assistants called Claude Code Agents. You can organize these helpers using shared plans that work like guides. This setup lets you automate and improve team tasks without technical skills.

It uses simple files everyone can share. That means you can coordinate multiple AI programs working together smoothly. The main idea is to help people get more done by having AI agents work as a team.

2. Add simple text files describing tasks for your AI helpers. These can be plain instructions like "Review code" or "Summarize meeting notes."
3. In the planning-with-teams app, find the option to select your planning folder. Point the app to the folder you created.
4. The app will read these files and start coordinating AI agents to help with each task.
